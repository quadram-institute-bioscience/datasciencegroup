# Data Science Group

Scripts and docs from the *Data Science Special Interest Group* at the 
[Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://www.quadram.ac.uk).

:warning: We are a **working group**. There are "*ice breakers*" but we would like to focus on
bringing together people who are already beyond the very first steps in R (or Python).


Materials and notes used to facilitate the discussions during the meetings.

* [Plotting Phylogenetic trees in R (Nabil-Fareed Alikhan)](1_phylogenetic_trees/data_science_1_makingtrees.ipynb)
* [Exploring Statistical Procedures and Their Implications in Data Science: A Simulation-Based Approach (George Savva)](https://github.com/georgemsavva/DataScienceGroup#readme)
* [Data Science in Python: a primer](python/README.md)
