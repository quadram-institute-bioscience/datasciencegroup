# Data Science Group

Scripts and docs from the *Data Science Special Interest Group* at the 
[Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://www.quadram.ac.uk).

:warning: We are a **working group**. There are "*ice breakers*" but we would like to focus on
bringing together people who are already beyond the very first steps in R (or Python).
