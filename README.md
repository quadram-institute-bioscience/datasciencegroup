# Data Science Group

Scripts and docs from the *Data Science Special Interest Group* at the 
[Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://www.quadram.ac.uk).

:warning: We are a **working group**. There are "*ice breakers*" but we would like to focus on
bringing together people who are already beyond the very first steps in R (or Python).


Materials and notes used to facilitate the discussions during the meetings.

* [Plotting Phylogenetic trees in R (Nabil-Fareed Alikhan)](1_phylogenetic_trees/data_science_1_makingtrees.ipynb)
* [Exploring Statistical Procedures (George Savva)](https://github.com/georgemsavva/DataScienceGroup#readme)
* [Rarefaction of microbiome data (Matteo Calgaro)](https://mcalgaro93.github.io/randomtopics/rarefaction-practice-in-microbiome-data-analysis.html) ([data](2_rarefaction/README.md))
* [Machine Learning with Python](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UY6pvTyzaAuNIgJfXMwIWCEBryKdcVdb), Dr Dipali Singh

Introductory material:
* [Data Science in Python: a primer](python/README.md)
