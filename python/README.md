# Python for Data Science

Python has emerged as a leading language in data science due to its simplicity, flexibility, 
and vast range of powerful libraries and tools designed specifically for data analysis,
visualization, and machine learning. 

Libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) provide robust capabilities 
for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. 

Moreover, Python's compatibility with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch makes it suitable for deep learning. 

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), an open-source web application, 
allows for the creation and sharing of documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text, making Python a versatile tool for data science. 

## A first guided tour: Notebooks

Are you familiar with Python but never used Pandas?

No problems:

* [A first introdution to Pandas DataFrames](https://gist.github.com/telatin/a1fcf685f41d406ac5ed52f497aca13a)
* [A first introduction to Matplotlib](https://gist.github.com/telatin/cfaf8cfd89b310ac742b4e037603b2ab)

And a worked example using dataframes and plots:
