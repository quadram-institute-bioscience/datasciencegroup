Material for the QIB datascience group: Sumeet Tiwari

## Building custom AMR-database:
To build the a custom AMR-database following the following documentation:
[How to build panarg](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/ARG-Sniper/tree/main/datasets/db#how-to-build-panarg).

## How to generate mock-dataset:
[Preparation of synthetic community](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/ARG-Sniper/tree/main/datasets/raw-reads#preparation-of-synthetic-community)

## How to run predict AMR:
Kindly use the pipeline [ARG-sniper](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/ARG-Sniper) or you can run the individual tools by your own. The pipeline is still under development and more-detailed documentation will be available later.
