# Metagenomic profiling using Biobakery tools

The workshop is devided in two sessions, one "theory" session that details the main concepts and ideas behind the tools that are covered in this session followed by a hands-on session.

## Theory session overview:

In this session we will discuss: 
  - Overview of the metagenomic profiling with Biobakery workflow
  - Taxonomic profiling using Metaphlan4
  - Functional profiling using Humann3
  - Downstream analysis and vizualizations

## Hands-on session overview

In this hands-on session you will use R to :

### Metaphlan4 session:
  - Parse and wrangle the output from Metaphlan4 into a useful data object
  - Explore the Metaphlan4 taxonomic profiles
  - Use MaAslin2 to identify differentially abundant taxa in sample groups

### Humann3 session:
  - Look at the different aggregation and normalization methods of Humann3
  - Explore the functional pathways and look at species contributions to these pathways
