    "# Data Science at QIB: Making a basic phylogenetic tree in R with coloured tips\n",
    "\n",
    "A phylogenetic tree is a diagrammatic representation of the evolutionary relationships among different species or groups of organisms. It depicts the common ancestry and evolutionary history of these organisms based on their genetic or morphological characteristics. Phylogenetic trees provide a visual framework for understanding the branching patterns and divergence of species over time, illustrating the evolutionary connections and the sequence of speciation events. \n",

    "**About ggtree:**\n",
    "`ggtree` is an extension package built on top of `ggplot2` that specifically focuses on visualizing and annotating phylogenetic trees. `ggplot2` is a widely used data visualization package in R that provides a powerful and flexible framework for creating various types of plots.\n",
