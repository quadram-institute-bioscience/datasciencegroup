# Assessing multiple methods to detect Differentially Abundant features in Microbiome Experiments


> Guest speaker:
> *Dr Matteo Calgaro*, University of Verona (Italy)


## Workshop Overview

In this workshop we will:

- Discuss about methods to identify Differentially Abundant features in Microbiome Experiments
- See how to use [BENCHDAMIC](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/benchdamic.html) to automate the process of evaluating the best method for our dataset
